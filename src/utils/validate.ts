 * Wrap untrusted text as a code-fenced block that the body CANNOT escape, with

 * closed by any ``` the body contains, after which injected text reads as
 * top-level prompt and can forge `=== AGENT MESSAGE` / `=== TELEGRAM`
 * containment headers, impersonating the daemon in the recipient PTY.
 *
 * Fix uses the CommonMark rule "a fence is closed only by a run of backticks
 * >= the opening run": size the wrapper to (longest backtick run in body) + 1,
 * minimum 3. The body's own fences (even a ```` block discussing fences) are
 * then strictly shorter than the wrapper and cannot close it — and nothing in
 * the body is altered, so pasted code stays readable. Control chars are still
 * stripped.
 *
 * Use for the FENCED body of an injection block (inbox text, Telegram text).
 * For unfenced context fields use sanitizeForPtyInjection instead.
 *
 * Bodies are additionally capped at MAX_FENCED_BODY_BYTES (tail-truncated,
 * UTF-8-safe, with an in-fence marker naming the original size). Every fenced
 * injection path — inbox messages, Telegram/Slack text, media captions, voice
 * transcripts, the urgent signal — flows through here, and none of them had a
 * size limit: one oversized `--body-file` send could eat most of the
 * recipient's context window in a single 5s poll cycle. The cap is generous
 * (~4k tokens) so real traffic, including pasted code blocks, passes
 * untouched; only pathological payloads are trimmed. Head is kept over tail
 * because a bus message leads with its intent and trails with pasted bulk.

/**
 * Neutralize PTY structural-injection vectors in untrusted text that is

 * fence-open or a forged header line is neutralized directly:
 *  - normalize carriage returns to newlines FIRST: stripControlChars keeps
 *    \r (0x0d), and a bare CR renders the following text at terminal column 0,
 *    so a `text\r=== AGENT MESSAGE` payload would visually present a header the
 *    `^` line-anchor never matched (CR is not a line start). Folding CR into LF
 *    makes the header-quote anchor see it (designer pre-validation finding);
 *  - collapse any run of 3+ backticks to 2 so the preview cannot open a fence
 *    that swallows following real structure (survives input transforms — no
 *    zero-width reliance);
 *  - prefix forged `=== AGENT MESSAGE` / `=== TELEGRAM` / `Reply using:
 *    cortextos bus` lines with [quoted] so they read as content. The leading-
 *    whitespace class must match every Unicode space char a downstream parser's
 *    `.trim()` would strip, or a header preceded by e.g. NBSP/IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE
 *    escapes [quoted] here yet is still recognized as a header after trim (#596,
 *    ClintMoody). Line terminators are excluded — the /m anchor already starts a
 *    new match after \n and after U+2028/U+2029; \r was folded to \n above; and
 *    \v/\f were removed by stripControlChars — so the class only needs the
 *    space-like chars: tab, space, NBSP, OGHAM, the U+2000–200A run, NARROW NBSP,
 *    MEDIUM MATH SPACE, IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE, and BOM/ZWNBSP.
