// Cross-path restart-in-flight lock (2026-07-13 restart-storm fix).
//
// CONFIRMED root mechanism: the automated hang/context actuators (fast-checker.ts's
// forceHangRestart/forceContextRestart, calling AgentProcess.sessionRefresh() directly)
// and the manual/CLI restart path (agent-manager.ts's restartAgent, calling
// stopAgent+startAgent) are two structurally DIFFERENT call shapes on the same agent,
// sharing NO coordination. If both fire within seconds of each other, each is unaware
// the other already restarted the agent — both spawn a fresh session, producing two
// live duplicates. This lock is the single shared gate BOTH paths check first.
//
// GOVERNING PRINCIPLE — fail OPEN on lock-mechanism trouble: this lock exists to
// prevent a double-restart, not to gate whether a restart is allowed to happen at all.
// If the lock file itself can't be read/written, the safer default is to let the
// restart proceed (a hung/crashed agent staying hung is worse than an occasional
// double-restart from a rare fs error) — but that fallback is loud (returns a reason
// string a caller should log), never silent.

const STALE_MS = 2 * 60_000; // well beyond any real restart's duration; reclaim if the holder crashed mid-restart without releasing

/**
 * Attempt to acquire the restart-in-flight lock for an agent's state directory.
 * `source` identifies the caller (e.g. 'hang-detector', 'context-handoff',
 * 'manual-cli-restart') purely for logging/diagnostics — it has no effect on
 * acquisition logic (a second attempt from the SAME source is blocked too, not just
 * cross-source, since the point is "is a restart already in flight", not "is a
 * DIFFERENT kind of restart in flight").
 *
 * ATOMIC by construction: the primary acquire attempt is a SINGLE `writeFileSync`
 * with the `wx` flag (open with O_CREAT|O_EXCL — fails with EEXIST if the file
 * already exists), not a separate existsSync-then-writeFileSync pair. The prior
 * two-call version had a real TOCTOU window: two processes could both pass the
 * existsSync check before either's writeFileSync landed, both believing they'd
 * acquired. `wx` closes that at the OS level — the create-if-absent check and the
 * write happen as one atomic syscall.
